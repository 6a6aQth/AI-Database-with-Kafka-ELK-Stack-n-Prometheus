# AI Interactive Database with Kafka, ELK, and Prometheus Monitoring

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository will showcase a **DevOps-driven AI system** that interacts with a database, leveraging **Apache Kafka** for real-time messaging and **ELK Stack** for comprehensive monitoring and log management. Additionally, **Prometheus** will be integrated for advanced metrics collection and alerting.

The project is designed to highlight cutting-edge practices in **AI-augmented data pipelines**, **real-time monitoring**, and **streamlined observability**, demonstrating the intersection of **AI**, **data engineering**, and **DevOps** principles.

## 🌟 Key Features (Coming Soon)

- **AI-Powered Database Interaction**  
   An intelligent system that interfaces with a database to fetch, process, and analyze data efficiently.

- **Real-Time Event Streaming**  
   Apache Kafka will handle high-throughput messaging between AI services and the database.

- **Centralized Log Monitoring**  
   The ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack will provide detailed insights into system performance and logs.

- **Metrics and Alerts with Prometheus**  
   Seamless integration with Prometheus for real-time metrics, alerting, and performance monitoring.

- **DevOps-Focused Architecture**  
   Designed to showcase DevOps skills with containerized deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation.
